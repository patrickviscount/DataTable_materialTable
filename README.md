# DataTable

DataTable is a demonstration table to host information. It is written in React and majorly runs from the React Material Table Library which can be found here: [https://mui.com/](https://mui.com/) and [https://mui.com/material-ui/api/table/](https://mui.com/material-ui/api/table/).

This project contains two main parts.
1. The actual frontend table, for rendering all the information stylistically.
2. The backend json server, where all the information is served from. More information can be found here: [https://github.com/typicode/json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server)
## Installation

You will need two terminals to run this project successfully. One to host the front-end and one to host the backend. Likewise there are two places you must install npm packages.

```bash
// Within the DataTable_materialTable directory
npm install 
```
```bash
// Within the DataTable_materialTable directory
cd ./server/
npm install 
```

## Running the project
```bash
npm run start
```
```bash
cd ./server/
npm run start
```
Running these two npm module files will run and configure the project, and will open a tab on your browser when it is completed.
